this is a placeholder readme for now.
this repo will eventually hold a textbased card game called deck_jockey.
this game is solitaire for now but may be updated later to allow multiple players.
the goal is to use 3 card types in conjunction to reach the production goal in the least number of turns, command cards, loop cards, and operator cards.
commands can be played stright to the board and do a one time effect before being discarded.
loops can be used to play the same command for multiple turns at the cost of more resources.
operators can modify both commands and loops for additional effect.
fututre versions may allow players to interact wiyth eachother and disrupt their plays to get their own plays done faster, and other versions may have
other decks to play around with.

for now this game will only require python and bash, idk how this is gonna go fully yet.
