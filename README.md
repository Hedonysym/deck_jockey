this is a textbased card game called deck_jockey.

the goal is to reach the production goal of 10 in the least number of turns.

commands can be played stright to the board and do a one time effect before being discarded.
loops can be used to play the same command for multiple turns at the cost of more resources.
operators can modify both commands and loops for additional effect.

currently it is only local multiplayer, i have it set to 4 max but its really arbitarary.
fututre versions may allow players to interact wiyth eachother and disrupt their plays to get their own plays done faster, and other versions may have
other decks to play around with.

all libraries used are in the basic python package
